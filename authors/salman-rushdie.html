            <h2>Salman Rushdie - Author</h2>
            <p>Salman Rushdie is a British-Indian novelist and essayist, best known for his novels "Midnight's Children" and "The Satanic Verses".</p>
            <h3>Biography</h3>
            <p>Rushdie was born in Bombay (now Mumbai), India in 1947. He attended the University of Cambridge, where he studied history. After graduating, he worked as an advertising copywriter, and began writing his first novel in his spare time. His fourth novel, "Midnight's Children", won the Booker Prize in 1981, and is considered one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. "The Satanic Verses", published in 1988, was met with controversy and protests from many in the Muslim community, who accused Rushdie of blasphemy. The book was banned in several countries and a fatwa was issued against Rushdie by Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran, which forced Rushdie into hiding for several years.</p>
